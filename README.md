# Project Image Generator

I created web app where you can enter some text into it will generate an image based on that text. I was
able to do that using open ai's Dolly system which create realistic images and art from description using machine learning and AI not from the internet.


for this project I used node js, express, dot Env for setting the environment variable which is API key which I used to embelled the API in our project, 
dev dependency nodemon and HTML CSS and JavaScript for the frondend.
